		CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan<br>

		Name: Nicholas Neville<br><br>

		Goals:<br>
		Slammers need a website to gain interest in their business. They believe that having a website will increase the amount of customers by 50%, while also gaining a younger audience.
		The site would benefit the client by having Slammers Volleyball information (contacts, where they are, about the game) online which would make it much easier to access and to gain an audience.<br><br>

		Success Evaluation:<br>
		
		If Slammers revenue increases it can attributed to the sites recent success, especially as there are no other advertisements that could be related to the businesses growth. 
		Having a site up exposes the company more which results in more people seeing/potentially wanting to play volleyball.<br><br>

		Target Audience:<br>

		Describe two things clearly and specifically:<br>
		Slammer sites target audience is 15-30 year olds.<br>
		The website will be designed to suit the younger audience. Some ways to attract younger people include:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Colourful user interface (used a green/yellow theme to give it a beach volleyball feel)</li>
			<li>User interaction (hovering over container areas display a green bar, hover over links change button colour)</li>
			<li>Mobile friendly website as younger people generally use their phones/tablets to browse the internet (mobile nav menu with animations)</li>
			<li>Use images to keep the user interested, no one just wants to read text</li>
		</ul>
