				<p>Volleyball started in the U.S. and is now becoming increasingly popular around the world, second to soccer among participation sports.
				Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are divided by a net. 
				Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other side of the court and tries to prevent the ball from being grounded on their own court.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				A team can hit the ball three times (plus the block contact) before returning it to the opponent's court.
				The ball is put into play by the player to the right in the back row who hits the ball over the net into the opponent's court.</p>
				<br>
				<img class="img_thin" src="../images/game.jpg"><br>
				<p>A player is not allowed to hit the ball more than once, unless the ball is passed to another player then back or attempting a block. 
				The back and forth continues until the ball goes out of the court, touches the ground or a team doesn't hit it back over the net or commits a fault.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). 
				When a team wins a rally, they gain both the right to serve and get a point on their score, the players on the team then rotate one position clockwise.
				The best of three or best of five games will win matches.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). 
				If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).</p>
